Some of the git commands that I feel I will use most frequently are, 
git init, obviously to make a repo
git add, to add the files to the stagin area 
git commit -m, to commit staged files and adda description
git remote add origin <url>, to link local repo to the repo on another server
such as github
git push and pull, to push and pull changes made to the repo on the server.
